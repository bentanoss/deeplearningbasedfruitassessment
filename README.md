# deeplearningbasedfruitassessment üçéüçåüçä

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and documentation for a third-year project focusing on automated fruit quality assessment using deep learning models, specifically comparing **YOLOv8** and **ResNet-34** architectures.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to test and compare automated fruit quality assessment based on external appearance (defects, bruises, discolorations) of two deep learning approaches:
- **ResNet-34** for classification of fruits into categories like fresh or defective.
- **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection and defect localization.

Both models were trained and evaluated to determine the most suitable approach for industrial fruit quality control applications.

## Key Findings

| Model     | Task                      | F1-Score | Object Detection | Speed          |
|-----------|----------------------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| ResNet-34 | Fruit Quality Classification| ~98%     | No               | Fast           |
| YOLOv8    | Detection + Classification  | ~93%     | Yes              | Real-time      |

- **ResNet-34** achieves higher accuracy for classification tasks.
- **YOLOv8** enables real-time detection and localization of multiple fruits and defects.
